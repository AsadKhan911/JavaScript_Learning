ARRAY METHODS:-

1). toString(): This method is used to convert an array to a string.

2). join(): The join method join all the array elements with a seperator which we gave to the function as an argument.
EXAMPLE:
let arr = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4]
let newarr1 = arr.join("-")
console.log(newarr1)
console.log(typeof newarr1)

OUTPUT: 1-2-3-4
TYPE = STRING //As it also converts the type of an array to a string.

3). pop(): This method is used to pop out the last element from an array. //if we want to know what pop function returns, so the it returns the element which is popped. (means the last element).

4). push(): It adds the new element at the end of the existing array and returns the new array length.
 let r = arr.push(5) //push returns new the array length.
console.log(arr , r)
OR we can push more than one elements once.
 let r = arr.push(5,6,7) //push returns the new array length.
console.log(arr , r)

5). shift(): This method removes the first element from an array and returns the first element which is removed.

6). unshift() : This method is used to Inserts new elements at the start of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
