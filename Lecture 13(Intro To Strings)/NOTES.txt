What is String? : It is a collection of characters.
.length function is use to find the length of a string.

In java we have 3 types of strings:-

1). Double quote Strings: let name = "Asad"
2). Single quote Strings: let name = 'Asad'

In JavaScript, both single quotes (') and double quotes (") can be used to create string literals. There is no functional difference between the two in terms of creating strings. 

NOTE: The string started with double quote will end also with double quotes, and with single quote will end also with single quote.

let name = "Asad' //DONT DO THIS

WE CAN ACCESS THE SPECIFIC WORD OF A STRING:

console.log(name[0])
console.log(name[1])
console.log(name[2])
console.log(name[3])

//TEMPELATE LITERALS
let sentence = `boy0 is a friend of boy1`
console.log(sentence)

If we print like this it will print as it is. But if we want to print whats inside the variables we will do like this.

STRING INTERPOLATION: We can insert variables directly in the backticks(``) this is called string interpolation.

ESCAPE SEQUENCE CHARACTER:

\' : This escape sequence character is used when we want to print a single quote within a single quote for some reason for example Asad's so this \' will treat as a single character.
let ESC = 'This is Asad\'s Book'
console.log(ESC)

\" : This escape sequence character is used when we want to print a double quote within a double quote for some reason for example Asad's so this \" will treat as a single character.
let ESC = 'This is Asad\'s Book'
console.log(ESC) 

\n : This is use to print a new line.
