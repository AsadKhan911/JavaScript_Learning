DIFFERENCE BW console.log() & console.dir():

The main differnce bw both is when we use console.log() it just simply print that line of code in html.
When we use console.dir() it print that line of code like js object which contains all the properties of that object.

EXAMPLE : 

console.log(document.getElementsByTagName("span")[0])
 <span>Hey I am span</span>

console.dir(document.getElementsByTagName("span")[0])
OUTPUT: -> span as an object

Differnce bw TAGNAME VS NODENAME:

document.body.firstChild.nodeName
'#text' //it will return node name such as(text,comment etc)
document.body.firstElementChild.nodeName
'SPAN' //it will return element nodes name.

INNER HTML: Anything written in the particular HTML element is inner HTML. The innerHTML property allows to get the HTML inside the element as a string. (VALID FOR ONLY ELEMENT NODES).

-> We can access it using first.innerHTML (where first is the id of span element we access) or accessing it by $0 or by DOM methods

EXAMPLE: first.innerHTML
OUTPUT:  'Hey I am span'

-> We can also change the innerHTML of a particular element

EXAMPLE : 

first.innerHTML = "HEY I AMMMMM" /It will change the inner html to this of element with id first.

OUTER HTML: outerHTML is a property that represents the entire HTML content of an element, including the element's own opening and closing tags.
When you access or modify the outerHTML property, you are dealing with the entire HTML representation of the element.

EXAMPLE: first.outerHTML
OUTPUT:  '<span id="first">HEY I AMMMMM</span>'

-> We can also change the outerHTML of a particular element

EXAMPLE: first.outerHTML = '<div>HELLO</div>'

IT WILL CONVERT SPAN WITH ID = first TO HELLO INSIDE DIV

FOR TEXT NODES AND COMMENT WE USE .data and .nodeValue: (CHECK HTML DOC FOR THE VALUES OF HTML)
document.body.firstChild.data
'\n    hello\n    '
document.body.firstChild.nodeValue
'\n    hello\n    '

TEXT CONTENT: This property copies the text of the entire element we gave to it. If we give body to it , it will give the entire text of the whole body to us.

EXAMPLE: document.body.textContent

HIDDEN PROPERTY: This property is used to hide any element in HTML.

EXAMPLE: <span id="first" hidden>Hey I am span</span> //Now it will hide this span in the Document

-> We can also access this element in console if it is hidden. By making it its value to false.

EXAMPLE: console.log(first.hidden = false) //Now the console will show the hidden element. We can use this while making websites where we want to show a particular element in some conditions , so there we will make its value to false.
