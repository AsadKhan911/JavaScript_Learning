FUNCTIONS:-

Functions in javascript are nothing but a piece of code which we can resuse by just calling its name.
Function can have any name.
Function must be unqiue in name.
The variables assigned to function works locally inside the function.

//SIMPLE FUNCTIONS
function OnePlusAvg(x,y)
{
    return 1+(x+y)/2
}

//ARROW FUNCTIONS
const hello = ()=>
{
    console.log("HELLO")
}

ARROW FUNCTION is nothing but a preferable way to write functions in javascript.
