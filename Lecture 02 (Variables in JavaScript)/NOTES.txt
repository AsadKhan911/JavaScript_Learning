console.log() is use to print in javascript
VARIABLES:-

To initialize variable in javascript we can use var a = 50 OR let a = 50
NOTE: Java script can change variable type in runtime.
EXAMPLE: 
let a = 50
console.log(a)
a = "asad"
console.log(a)

Means when we initialize it will give answer 50 but when we do a="asad" it automatically changes the datatype of variable from num to character and show result asad for console.log(a)

RULES FOR CHOOSING VARIABLE NAME:-

1). Letters, digits, underscores & dollar($) sign allowed. 
2). Must begin with $ or _ or letter. (can't start with numbers)
3) JavaScript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name.
4). Asad or aSad are different variables (javascript is a case sensitive langugae).
