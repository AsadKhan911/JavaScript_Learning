Part 1: Group software project portfolio.

Working as a team,this coursework will allow you to demonstrate your ability to analysea problem and break this into requirements that you will model , prototype and develop a software solution for. This will be carried out using an agile approach to software engineering/development.

Design, Develop and deploy a digital service or game related to your life as a student on or off campus.
Game version(for Students on computer science for games development):
Consider all aspects of your life and around camput. What aspects or situations would be suited to desigining a game around? The game can be for entertainment, creating social connections or more alligned to helping you with your studies. The game can be team-based or for individual players.

Cosnider all aspects of your life as a student. What aspects could be improved through the introduction of a digital service. Note that sometimes the instruction of a poorly designed digital service can make the experience worse,and some successful digital services rely on face-to-face interactions in additio to digial support.
