ALWAYS USE LET AND CONST.
What is ES6?
As the javascript involves there are new features introduced in it and that javascript new version you can is called ES6(Ecma Script6).

Var vs Let in JS:

1). Var i globally scoped while let & const are block scoped.(Globally scoped means we can change variable value at any place. Suppose we initialize a value a=10 to a variable and after some lines we initialize the same variable a new value a=21 so the value of a will be 21 throughout the code , which can cause bug or error when code is big). (Blocked scope are varible whose value is once defined cant change)

EXAMPLE FOR GLOBAL SCOPE:

var a = 10
{
    var a = 20
    console.log(a)
}
console.log(a)

The output will be 20 , 20


EXAMPLE FOR BLOCK SCOPE:

let a = 10
{
    let a = 20
    console.log(a)
}
console.log(a)

The output will be 20,10.

2). Var can be redeclared & updated within its scope.
3). Let can't be redeclared.
let a = 10
a = 8
console.log(a) This can be done in let and outwill be 8 as it is not declared just we changed the variable value.

EG: line:1 let a=5 , line:2 let a=4 (VAR WILL NOT THROW ERROR, LET WILL THROW ERROR)

CONST:(Constant)

Constant can't be changed or redeclared once iniatilized in the memory.
const a = 10
a = 8
console.log(a) This cannot be done in const and outwill be error as it cannot declared again or update again.
