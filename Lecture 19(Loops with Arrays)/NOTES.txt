FOR LOOP WITH ARRAYS:

let arr = [1,2,4,5,7,8,12]
for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++)
{
    console.log(arr[i])
}

This will print the simple array.

If we want to print 1*1 , 2*2 , 3*3 etc for each element we will use for each.

arr.forEach((element) => //imp for react apps. for each loop.
{
    console.log(element*element)
})

In this we use forEact loop to print the square of each element.

//ARRAY.FROM(): This function is used to convert an string or numbers into an array
arr = "Asad"
let new_arr = Array.from(arr)
console.log(new_arr)

OUTPUT: ['A', 's', 'a', 'd']

FOR OF LOOP: This is used to print the items in an array, just like we used to print in an object with this.
let arr_1 = [1,2,4,5,7,8,12]
for(let items of arr_1)
{
    console.log(items)
}
OUTPUT: 
1
2
4
5
7
8
12 //items in an arry.

FOR IN LOOP: This is used to print the index numbers of an array.
arr_1 = [1,2,4,5,7,8,12]
for(let items in arr_1)
{
    console.log(items)
}
OUTPUT:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6 //indexes numbers.
