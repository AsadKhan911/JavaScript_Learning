Q1: Write a program to print the marks of a student in an object using for loop.

Solution: 

let marks = {
    'Asad': 87,
    'Khan': 71,
    'Adil':82,
    'Affan':42
}

for(let i=0; i<Object.keys(marks).length; i++)
{
    console.log("Marks of student "+Object.keys(marks)[i]+" are "+marks[Object.keys(marks)[i]])
}

In this Object.keys(marks).length means all the keys (means Asad,Khan,Adil,Affan just these..keys basically means the values on the left side).
After that in loop Object.keys(marks) is same just we add [i] with it means at 0 it will print Asad, at 1 it will print Khan and so on...
After that marks[Object.keys(marks)[i] will print the values on left side. It is the method to print the values of the left side.

Q2: Write the program in Q1 using for in loop.
SOLUTION:
let marks = {
    'Asad': 87,
    'Khan': 71,
    'Adil':82,
    'Affan':42
}
for(let a in marks)
{
    console.log("Marks of "+a+" are "+marks[a])
}
It print the left values with a , and right values with marks[a]...for in loop is basically designed to solve such questions.

Q3: Write a program to print "try again" until the user enters the correct number.
SOLUTION:
console.log("CORRECT NUMBER IS 5")
let num
while(num!=5)
{   
   num = prompt("ENTER CORRECT NUMBER")
   console.log("TRY AGAIN")
}

Q4: Write a function to find the mean of 5 numbers.
SOLUTION:
const mean=(a,b,c,d,e) => { //ARROW FUNCTION
     return (a+b+c+d+e)/5
}

console.log("MEAN = "+mean(1,2,3,4,5))
