TABLE NAVIGATION:

Just like we have different DOM Manipulation methods to access first child , to nth child or parents etc.

-> We have also some seperate properties for the table aswell. While working on table in DOM we can use these properties.

-> Consider 't' as a table

1). t.rows (To get all the rows of the table).
2). t.tHead (To get tHead of the table).
3). tFoot (To get tFoot of the table).
4). t.tBodies (to access tBody of the table).
5). tbody.rows (access collection of <tr> inside)
6). tr.cells (to access collection of td and th)
7). tr.sectionRowIndex( tr.section[0] like this)..(access index of tr inside enclosing element)
8). tr.rowInside (access Row number starting form 0)
9). td.cellIndex( td.cell[0],td.cell[1] etc like this)...(access no of cells inside encloisng <tr>)
