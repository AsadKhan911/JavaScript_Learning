SCRIPT TAG: To write javascript in browser , we use script tag to use it.

There are 2 Methods to link javaScript script tag:

1). Link at the end of the HTML body tag just before closing the body tag.
<body>
    HELLO
    <script src="tut24.js"></script>
</body>

2). Write javaScript inside the html body , which can be done by writting java script in script tag. You can say inline javascript. (Most prefered).

<body>
    HELLO
    <script>
        alert("HELLO")
    </script>
</body> 

Advantages of using method number 2:

1). Seperation of concerns(Means different javaScript file can work in different tasks , such as button handling, music play etc).
2). Browser Caching. (It reduces our caching size , by loading all files at once and saves them , and dont loads all files again when the page gets reload.

NOTE: If user tried to do this:-

<script src="tut24.js">
	console.log("HELLO I AM ASAD") //Javascript will ignore this inside javascript , and only run the linked file javascript.
</script>
