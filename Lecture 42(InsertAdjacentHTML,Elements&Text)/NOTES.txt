insertAdjacentHTML: The insertAdjacentHTML() method in JavaScript allows you to insert HTML content at a specified position relative to an element. It provides a way to dynamically add or change HTML content around a given element without overwriting its entire content.

The method takes two parameters:

1).Position String:

It specifies where to insert the HTML content in relation to the target element. It can take one of the following values:
"beforebegin": Inserts the HTML content immediately before the target element.
"afterbegin": Inserts the HTML content as the first child of the target element.
"beforeend": Inserts the HTML content as the last child of the target element.
"afterend": Inserts the HTML content immediately after the target element.

NOTE: Position names are not case sensitive.

2).HTML String:

It is a string containing the HTML content to be inserted.
EXAMPLE IN CODE FILE.

let id1 = document.getElementById("id1")
