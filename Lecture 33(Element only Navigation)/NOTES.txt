DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHILD OR ELEMENT CHILD:-

Suppose in previous lectures when we were try to accessing the children of a particualar element and if there is a space or the next element is in the next line it prints the first child as text. 

EG: </head>
<body>
    <nav>
      
    </nav>
    <script src="tut33.js"></script>
</body>

Now , if we do document.body.firstChild , it will return us text instead of <nav> , because the nav is in next line and before it there is a space because of the nav is in the next line of the body.(This is because only doc.body.firstchild returns node.

But if we want to get rid of this problem and wheteher the nav is in next line or there are multiple spaces between nav and body , but still it will return first child as nav. 

-> For that we use ELEMENT CHILD. 

EG: <body>
    <nav>
      
    </nav>
    <script src="tut33.js"></script>
</body>

document.body.firstElementChil , now it will return <nav> (THIS IS KNOWN AS ELEMENT ONLY NAVIGATION). (it returns element).

WE CAN ACCESS ANY SIBLING LIKE THIS: 
document.body.previousElementSibling
document.body.nextElementSibling
document.body.firstElementSibling
document.body.lastElementSibling
