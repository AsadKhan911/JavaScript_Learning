DOM MANIPULATION: DOM manipulation refers to the process of changing or updating the content, structure, or style of a webpage using JavaScript. DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface that represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. Each element in an HTML document, such as paragraphs, headings, and images, is represented as an object in the DOM.

DOM TREE: The DOM tree, or Document Object Model tree, is a hierarchical structure that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document in a way that can be manipulated using programming languages like JavaScript. In easy words, you can think of it as a tree-like structure where each element in a document is a node, and these nodes are organized in a parent-child relationship.

DOM TREE referes to the html oage where all the nodes are objects. There can be 3 main types of nodes in the DOM TREE:
1). Text nodes.
2). Element nodes.
3). Comment nodes.

IMP INTERVIEW QUESTION: A text node is always a leaf node of the tree.(Because we can't put anything in the tree).

AUTO-CORRECTION: Suppose in html we make a span and we put span tag like this <span>Hello world</div> , Like we open with span and close with div tag , this means its not a valid html , but when we do such mistakes browser will AUTO CORRECT this mistake and clos the span tag by itself in browser like this <span>Hello world</span>
OR
If we write something outside the body it will put automatically it into inside the body.
Another example is <table> tag which must contain <tbody>

WALKING THE DOM: Walking the DOM" refers to the process of moving through the Document Object Model (DOM) tree and interacting with its elements using programming code, often with languages like JavaScript.

A typical HTML Page looks like this:
<html>
<head>
<title>hello</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

How to access these tags in JavaScript using DOM manipulation:

DOCUMENT: Document has childrens such as  html,head,body,title etc. We can access them like this:(HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHOLE HTML DOCUMENT)

1). document.body = It will access us to the html body
2). document.head = It will access us to the html head
3). document.documentElement = It will access us to the html tag (WHOLE HTML INCLDUIND BODY AND HEAD)

NOTE: document.body can sometimes be null if the javascript is written before the body tag.(Because it is before body , so obviously it will return null,thats why we write javascript at the end of the body).

TYPES OF EACH(FOR INTERVIEW):

1). typeof document.body
    'object'

2). typeof document.head
    'object'

3). typeof document.documentElement
    'object'

4). typeof document.title (REMEMBER TITLE WILL RETURN STRING NOT OBJECT)
    'string'
